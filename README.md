> [!NOTE] Make you feel Home 
> In gRPC Clinet , you don't have to fetch data from API or call a API with data to make API do some work , 
> in gRPC , client will feel like it's all local , like a monolithic architecture 
> 
> call any function from different microservices just like it's your own function and receive the response from the server
